#### By **Brian Mumo Paul**
## Description
This is a website designed for Delani studio. It allows the user to book a studio session or send a message using a form input at the bottom. It also has additional features like hovering and toogle used in various parts of the website.

## Behaviour Driven Development
The website has a form input which accepts user data and alerts the user if the message has been sebt successfully.
 
When the user clicks on the submit button without entering any data it alerts him/her that the message can't be sent without a name and email

|name| email| response|  
|:--- | :---:| :---:|
|  null  |  null   |   how can i book a studio  | 

Output will be: cannot send message without name and email
 
 
 |name| email| response|  
|:--- | :---:| :---:|
